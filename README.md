# COVID-19-Death-Analysis
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCov) appeared in China, causing an international public health emergency within a few weeks. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently classified it as a very high-risk virus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) designated this virus as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness as Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19). Out of the approximately 110,000 documented cases of this infection, the virus has killed close to 3,600 people as of March 8, 2020. In this editorial, the most important facts and features about COVID-19—an emerging coronavirus infection—its causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, the current global situation, and recent and ongoing efforts to contain and control the disease—which has now spread to over 100 countries worldwide—are briefly reviewed. Notably, scientists and health organizations from all over the world are working together to stop the virus's spread and prevent a pandemic, which would otherwise endanger the lives of millions of people.
